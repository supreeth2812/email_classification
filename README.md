# Case study – Enron email classification 

## Description
The Enron corpus is a large database of over 600,000 emails generated by 158 employees of the Enron Corporation and acquired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation after the company's collapse.

## Prerequisites

  Requires python 3.5 and following python packages pre-installed :
* Pandas 
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn
* NLTK

## Dataset
The dataset is cleaned and have removed the email headers and contains only body of the sent messages along with the file name.

Fields
* file : file name under mailbox directory and the hierarchy is constructed as <sender_name>/<mailbox_type>/<file_number>

## Solution Devoloped

### 1. Top 10 senders
The file name has the sender information as part of the filename. All the filenames follow a similar pattern and we use string split to split the file name into 3 fields namely – Sender, Folder and File number. Then we extract the sender column from this and add it to our original dataset. Next we use value counts to find which sender has the maximum rows in the dataset hence giving us the answer for top 10 senders.


### 2. Email Classification
*I build a Multi-class Logistic Regression Classifier to predict the sender based on the body of the email.*
